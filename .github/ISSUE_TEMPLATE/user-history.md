# Steps to acceptable User History
## About title
Please, write this issue title with user history format. Something like that:

`As a <role or persona>, [I can | I want to] <goal/need/be able to perform/do something> so that <I get some form of value/benefit>`

## Content
A user history is not about task, but definitions. So, you must add all definitions you have under title subject. Wireframes, business rules, validations, especial conditions, data modeling and etc.

## Tasks
Task is about implementation. So, you may have some tasks to archieve the subject proposed by User Story.

Now, you have to ways:

In a small team - ou smal User history - maybe this history may be done by one person only. In this case, you can place all tasks descriptions here like this
* [ ] - Task 1
* [ ] - Task 2
* [ ] - Task 3

Github will show to you the progress of work.

But if you have a bigger team and the story is more complicated (or task may be done in parallel), could be a good idea control the task with a card. In this case, anote all tasks cards here with link to each one.
* [ ] - #999 - Task 1
* [ ] - #888 - Task 2

And so on.
There's no automatized control to mark the task as done. Discipline is fundamental.
